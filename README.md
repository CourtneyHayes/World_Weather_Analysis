### Module 6 API 

#### Project Overview
Using feedback from Jack and the beta tester, changes are made to the PlanMy Trip App. Adding in the weather description to the weather data to improve user experience.
We have used weather description data already retireved for this module to enhance the app. Beta testers will then use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, these will then be used to find a potential destination as well as the nearby hotels. The beta testers will then choose 4 cities from the list of potential destinations in order to create their travel itenrary. The last step is using Google Maps API ket to create a travel between the fours cities and a marker layer map.

#### Deliverables
1. Retrieve weather data
2. Create a customer travel destinations map
3. Create a travel itinerary map


### Conclusion
Being able to add these features will greatly improve the users experience with the app therfore making it more successful for the company. Continued evalutation and beta testing using these function could find help identify other improvements.
